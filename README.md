# Grid-Guardian
This project is a pet-project designed to gather and display all my knowledge in Unity. I used *Zenject* and *Addressables*, and built architecture following *OOP principles* and *SOLID*. I also used *Factory Method* and *State Machine patterns*. Additionally, I have implemented a save progress system and integrated rewarded ads.
